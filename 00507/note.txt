This problem is quite specific, half dynamic programming, half greedy.
The key point is restart a search for max value when sum < 0 i.e.: there is no meaning searching a maximum sum at a negative amount.
One important thing is: we need to keep track of the current start point and current end point, in order to compare them later (to break ties). 
We can do this in many ways, there exist many "costo" ways, but we can always do with just two additional ints.
