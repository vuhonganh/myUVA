# UVA problem 10020: minimal coverage
Type: greedy, interval covering

1) Sort the input: the input is a set of interval, should sort it according to its left-end 

2) We need to choose the minimal amount of interval that they will cover the segment [0, M] 

3) take a current covering point (first at 0)
   a) for every interval that left side is not greater than this covering point, the next covering point will be the maximal of the right-end of one of these intervals
   b) update the covering point is the maximal value found above and repeat
