//UVA 11264 Coin Collector problem:
//Type: greedy type, need to write down and think a little bit
//some fact:
1) we can always get first coin C(1) and the maximum value coin C(n)
2) Need to think in a dynamic programming fashion:
   a) consider we have to withdraw S make the most out of C(1) -> C(i-1) coins, how about the coin C(i)?
   b) we will get this coin if S + C(i) < C(i+1) and don't get it otherwise
