//UVA 11389 Bus Driver: greedy type
//because of the specific condition of this problem, it's not so difficult to solve
//just need to sort two arrays: the morning route length and the evening route length
//then, take the sum of two arrays with decreasing direction of evening route length
//greedy idea: the best we can do is to make pair of the max value of evening route with the min value of the morning route
